Some devices such as TVs, game consoles, streaming devices, printers, and digital assistants will require you to
add the deviceâ€™s unique wireless Media Access Control (MAC) address to the network before the device will connect
to the {{ config('app.property_name') }} network.<br>
<br>
Using our website below, you will be able to add your own devices to {{ config('app.property_name') }} network.
Please note this process is only required for devices which will not connect to the WiFi using your regular username
and password.<br>
<br>
Visit <a target="_blank" href="{{ config('app.url') }}">{{ config('app.url') }}</a> and sign in with your username and password.  After inputting the wireless MAC address of
your device to the website please connect that device to the WiFi titled {{ config('app.property_name') }} PSK and use the
word {{ config('app.psk_password') }} as the password.<br>
<br>
If you have and trouble please reach out to us at support@iqmachines.com and we would be happy to assist you.<br>
<br>
Thanks <br>
